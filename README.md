# BadAppleOnVexV5Brain

Suppose To run at 60 FPS but runs at 60 fps for like 3 seconds and starts to slow down. Also don't worry about the comments I made, they were to test if it would work or not.

Just to say this program isn't perfect and you need most of the frames of Bad Apple to run it on.
Name your frames "FRAMES0000" with the zeros being what number each frame is. (I worked with VLC media player to name and get each frame.)
